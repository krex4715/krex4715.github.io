Virtual reality for fitness and health care applications require accurate and real-time pose estimation for interactive features. <br><br> 

Yet, they suffer either a limited angle of view when using handset devices such as smartphones and VR gears for capturing human pose or a limited input interfaces when using distant imaging/computing devices such as Kinect. <br><br>

Our Team goal was to marry these two into an interactive metaverse system with human pose estimation.<br>
This paper describes the design and implementation of Yoroke, a distributed system designed specifically for human pose estimation for interactive metaverse system. It consists of a remote imaging device for estimating human pose, and a handset device for implementing a multi-user interactive metaverse system. We have implemented and deployed Yoroke on embedded platforms and evaluated its effectiveness in delivering accurate and real-time pose estimation for multi-user interactive metaverse platform.
