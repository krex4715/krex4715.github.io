The Stewart-Gough platform(a.k.a Stewart Platform) is a type of 6-DOF manipulator with six Prismatic Actuators.<br>
Stewar Platform generally has the structure of<br>
- TOP Plate<br> 
- Spherical Joint (3-DOF)<br>
- Linear Actuator<br>
- Universial Joint (2-DOF)<br>
- Bottom Plate<br>

<br>
Because the Stewart Platform motor is oriented in a similar to  to the direction in which the force is to be applied (vertical to the upper plate),<br>
It has the advantage of having <u>a very high carrying load (high robustness)</u> and being able o <u>firmly control the movement of six degrees of freedom</u> even with simple mechanism.
